  <h1>About AdobeColorblind Analyzer</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>AdobeColorblind Analyzer</strong> is a tool designed to help designers, developers, and accessibility advocates
    identify potential colorblind accessibility issues on websites. By analyzing your website’s color usage, this tool provides insight into how content might appear to users with various types of color vision deficiencies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Accessibility is a critical aspect of modern web design. An estimated <strong>1 in 12 men</strong> and <strong>1 in 200 women</strong> are affected by color vision deficiency.
    Ensuring that your site remains usable and clear to everyone—regardless of how they perceive color—is not only inclusive but often required by accessibility standards.
